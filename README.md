[Front End] (http://mind-drift.netlify.com/)
[Back End] (https://mind-drift-be.herokuapp.com/)

mindDrift is a mindful breathing app developed for those who need an easy, on-the-go way to focus on taking deep breaths and to practice being still. Designed with the user experience in mind, mindDrift is a sleek, minimalist app that focuses on the inhale and exhale, without all of the extra fluff. 

For those who have a little more experience with mindful breathing, they are able to go into settings to create, or customize their own breathing exercise. Achievements are available if users sign in for 2, 5, 10, 25, or 50 days in a row. Users will also get a first time achievement after their first log-in. 

## How It Works

The user is able to log-in using an email and password, and is immediately sent to the home page where they can choose to Breathe or setup a breathing pattern. Should they choose Breathe, they will be sent to our breathing page that is loaded with a default breathing pattern instructing them to inhale, exhale and hold dependent on the animation and timer associated with it. There is a progress bar at the bottom of the screen that will finish when the session is complete, and alert the user that they're session is complete. 

The user is also able to go to our Setup page and pick a different default breathing pattern, or even create their own pattern dependent on their own needs. 

## Data Aggregation



## How Itâ€™s Built
mindDrift's front-end was built using React and Redux. The back-end was built using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express. Our animations were created with the react-spring library. The back-end is deployed to Heroku, and the front-end is deployed to Netlify.
