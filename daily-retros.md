# Retros

## 12/5/19
- What went well
  - We shared ideas and did a good job saving "rabbit-hole" ideas for later, by marking them on sticky notes so we could proceed with development
  - We mobbed most of the day
  - Our biggest challenge early on was the Auth0 inegration. We had learned that Auth0 would replace any login that we would code ourselves (instead of layering on top of our own login)
